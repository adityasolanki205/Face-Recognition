## **Facial Recognition**

[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

This is a Facial Recognition application developed for **learning and implementation purpose only**. In this repository a model has been trained to detect and recognise faces of six individuals namely Aditya Solanki(Author), Ben Afflek, Madonna, Elton John, Jerry Seinfled, Mindy Kaling. The complete process is divided into 3 parts:

1. **Face Detection in a Photograph**.
2. **Implementation of FaceNet model on the extracted face**.
3. **Implementation of Linear Support Vector Machine to recognise the face**.


## Motivation
For the last one year, I have been part of a great learning curve wherein I have upskilled myself to move into a Machine Learning and Cloud Computing. This project was practice project for all the learnings I have had. This is first of the many more to come. 
 

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)


## Code Example

```bash
    # clone this repo, removing the '-' to allow python imports:
    git clone https://github.com/adityasolanki205/Face-Recognition.git
```

## Installation

Below are the steps to setup the enviroment and run the codes:

1. Data Setup: First the data setup has to be done. Download the [5 celebrity Dataset, Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/5-celebrity-faces-dataset). After the Download

2. 

```bash
    # After cloning we will run one code at a time
    git clone https://github.com/adityasolanki205/Face-Recognition.git
```
