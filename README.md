[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

This is a Facial Recognition application developed for **learning and implementation purpose only**. In this repository a model has been trained to detect and recognise faces of six individuals namely Aditya Solanki(Author), Ben Afflek, Madonna, Elton John, Jerry Seinfled, Mindy Kaling. The complete process is divided into 3 parts:

1. Face Detection in a Photograph
2. Implementation of FaceNet model on the extracted face.
3. Implementation of Linear Support Vector Machine to recognise the face.


## Motivation
For the last one year, I have been part of a great learning curve wherein I have upskilled myself to move into a Machine Learning and Cloud Computing. This project was practice project for all the learnings I have had. This is first of many more to come.
